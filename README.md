## Introduction

ENA is a software which creates/generates videos from a transcript of the video(audio background). We do not use AI to generate videos. However Audio is generated by [CloudTTS]. which is absolutely free. There are no fees, no plans, no quotas.

ENA generates the videos by downloading GIFs from [Giphy] and finally merging them with the generated audio from the transcript

So In-order to download gifs ENA uses the [Giphy Developers] program to fetch and download GIFs. You will have to create an [API Key] to plug in to ENA.

## Usage

you can use python to run the program and generate the desired video.
You can use the following command to generate a video.
```shell
python ena.py --transcript <transcript> 
```
### Generated video
The video will be saved in a new folder called `output` and the file name will be prefixed with `final` along with a timestamp.
